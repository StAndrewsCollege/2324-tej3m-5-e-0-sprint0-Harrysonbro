The final design of my paper tower includes a normal sized piece of paper
It is then cut into two pieces in length
Two small cuts were made to the top of each piece of paper
They are then put together, standing ontop of eachothher.

Next time, I could try cutting three pieces of paper and stacking three of them to make it even taller
I could also try making a foundation to strengthen the base of the tower.
